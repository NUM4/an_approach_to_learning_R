# Introduction to R workshop

There is only we can cover in an hour. So, I will use this hour to convince you on the why and give you pathways to how.

Before I get started:
- Why do you want to learn R
- Do you know version control

I think R is an easier language to transition to - if you are starting with data analysis outside of spreadsheets.

The community is helpful. Locally, there are strong communities as well, such as R Ladies Auckland.

Also, since it was developed at the University of Auckland - it is our local language.

I am going to aim to show few things, where and how can you get started.


## R Studio
One IDE to do your work.

Four panes.

Console - Script - Environment - Help.

## R Markdown
Data analysis is about communication.

You should be able to communicate to the future you, not only other people within the organisation.

Most of the knowledge regarding analysis lies within people’s heads, or archaic code that’s only understandable to them.

R Markdown is nowadays used to write books, create websites, reports and build interactive dashboards.
